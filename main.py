# contents to be covered:
# basic principles, control flow, advanced datatypes, functional programming, OOP, data aquisition, 3rd party libraries

# 1. created by Guido van Rossum in 1989 while working at 

# 2. Developement :
# python 2.0 released in 2000 :- last released was 2.7
# python 3.0 released in 2008 :- last released 3.9

# 3. Defination :- Python is a dynamically typed, general purpose programming language that supports an OOPs approach as well as a functional programming approach.

# 4. Implementations of python are : CPython & PyPy

# 5. The reference Python implementation is CPython

# 6. A little more about CPython 
# {Reference implementaion :- http://www.python.org
# It is open source written in C 
# Includes the standard library
# A collection of additional functionality that goes beyond just the python language}

# 7. Virtual Environment :- It is basically a copy of python with any additional libraries you need that you use to run a specific python project. 
# 8. Installing packages with pip :- 
        #    Activate the virtual environment first (It Sets your path)
        #    Pip install package_name (You can look at the pi pi, write the python index or look at the documentation for the library or package you want to install & it will tell you its package name. You can have specific different versions too.)
        #    Versions like - pip install package_name==1.3.2
        #                  - pip install package_name<=1.2
        #                  - pip install package_name>2.0
# Basic data types

# 10. Variables :- Variable is like a container that holds data. overtime, object symbol references can change.
#  a = 100 (here a is referencing the object 100)
#  a = true (here a is referencing the object true)
#  11. How Variable Assignment Happens ?
#.a = 0.728
# Here a isLHS and 0.728 is RHS
